🎨 Artify AI — AI-Powered Marketplace Assistant for Local Artisans.
Empowering Traditional Craftsmanship through Generative AI and Data Intelligence
🧩 Problem Statement

Local artisans often face challenges in marketing their crafts, sharing their authentic stories, and reaching wider digital audiences.
They lack access to data-driven insights, storytelling tools, and marketing resources that larger brands have — making it difficult to scale their craft sustainably.

🌟 Key Features
1️⃣ Story Generator (Gemini Flash 2.5)

Upload product image and description.

Generates authentic storytelling content about the craft and artisan journey.

Produces a Provenance Card (mini digital certificate for the craft).

2️⃣ Trend Finder

Extracts trending keywords, hashtags, and topics for better social reach.

Analyzes story context and predicts what style/content is performing best.

Calculates:

Optimized Cost

Negotiated Price Range

Sustainability Score

Improvement Tips

Based on a hybrid of AI reasoning + mathematical sustainability models.

Example:
Your product is 87% sustainable. Switching to natural dye and solar-dried processes can increase your score to 95%.

4️⃣ Market Demand Analysis

Generates 10-year demand graphs and 5-year predictions using AI and real data.

Identifies top competitor regions and growth opportunities.

Input validation: ensures meaningful analysis only for valid products (e.g., “clay pot” works, “asdfxx” doesn’t).

Results can be downloaded as a report.

5️⃣ Ad Creatives Generator

YouTube

Instagram

Facebook

Etsy
